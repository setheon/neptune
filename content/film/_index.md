  **From a young age, my fascination with cinema was profound. My childhood was marked by a deep love for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; on VHS, which I watched at every opportunity. Sci-fi classics like &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, &quot;Pacific Rim&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars&quot; were central to my upbringing, sparking a passion for filmmaking that began with Lego stop-motion animations and evolved into short films.<br><br>Although I initially pursued a career in I.T. after school, the field did not allow me to express as creatively as I would've liked to, so this led me to reassess my true calling. Embracing my deep-seated passion for cinema, I decided to follow my dreams and enrolled at Massey University in Wellington, New Zealand. I was accepted into the Bachelor of Screen Arts program, majoring in Film, and began my studies in 2023. Since then, I have been developing a diverse and comprehensive skill set in film technology while advancing my professional relationships within the film industry. I am set to graduate in December 2025.<br><br>On this page, you will find a showcase of my creative work from my time at Massey University, as well as cinema credits for the projects I have contributed to over the years. Enjoy!**
