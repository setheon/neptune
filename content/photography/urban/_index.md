    High-density urban areas have always fascinated me since I was a kid, big cities, all those people. My hometown had only a few tall buildings, and there were only so many photos you could take of the same subject before it became monotonous for both me and the viewer. <br><br> So when I moved from my small suburban city to Wellington (the capital city of New Zealand), you can imagine my excitement at encountering all these new subjects. <br><br> Three years later, I still gleefully walk around the city, taking photos of the buildings here. I hope to venture beyond New Zealand after my studies conclude and explore mega cities such as Tokyo and Shanghai to unleash my artistic urban potential.<br><br> I am also fascinated by a variety of infrastructure projects and have included them in my work displayed here. Enjoy!
