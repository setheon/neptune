    Nianyi Liu is an international student from China whom is studying Film at Massey University. We've crossed paths many times throughout our degrees and during a cold october evening we walked around Wellington city doing a city wide photoshoot. Some of these photos I took of her have been to this day my favourite photos I've taken.
