title: PORTRAITURE

oneLabel: About
one: |
  I find capturing people through my lens to be one of the most intimate forms of photography. There's something deeply personal about freezing a moment of someone's life, their unique expressions, and the subtle nuances that make them who they are. Each portrait tells a story—one of joy, contemplation, or even vulnerability—that resonates with me.
